***Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?***
Artemis Financial is a financial institution, that aims to enhance the security measures within its existing application.

***What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely?What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?***
one of the key things I did well was identifying false positives and effectively filtering them out to ensure the focus remained on actual threats. Secure coding is essential to protect software systems from potential exploitation. It ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.  Strong software security enhances a company’s reputation, ensures compliance, and provides a stable foundation for long-term growth.

***Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?***
The dependency check tool proved most helpful by providing an efficient way to detect vulnerabilities, saving the effort of manually reviewing each dependency.

***How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?***
I enhanced security by updating libraries, as many vulnerabilities stemmed from outdated versions. In the future, I would rely on tools like dependency checkers and vulnerability scanners to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity.

***How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?***
I ran the code after each change to check for issues, and after making significant updates, I performed another vulnerability check.

***What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?***
For resources I stackoverflow, and OWASP for vulnerability checks

***Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?*** 
I would highlight my ability to create a self-signed certificate, correctly perform dependency checks, carry out checksum verifications, identify and hide false positives, and conduct research to resolve vulnerabilities.
